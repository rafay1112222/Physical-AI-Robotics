# Gemini Project Context

## Directory Overview

This directory appears to be a general-purpose project. The specific contents and purpose are not immediately clear from the file structure.

## Key Files

*   **GEMINI.md**: This file, which you are currently reading, is intended to provide context and instructions for interacting with the project via the Gemini CLI.

## Usage

To get started, you can provide more information about the project's goals. For example:

*   "This is a project for writing a book about..."
*   "I'm using this directory to store research papers for..."

Once I have more context, I can provide more specific assistance.
