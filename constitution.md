# Project Constitution: Spec-Driven Technical Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This Constitution outlines the non-negotiable rules for content, format, and structure for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" technical textbook project, built using Docusaurus and Spec-Kit Plus. All contributors, human or AI, must adhere to these guidelines.

## 1. Content Rules

*   **Technical Accuracy**: All textbook content must be technically accurate, thoroughly researched, and reflect current knowledge and best practices in the field of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
*   **Target Audience**: The content must be suitable for an advanced university-level course, assuming a foundational understanding of mathematics, physics, computer science, and basic AI concepts.
*   **Syllabus Adherence**: The textbook content will strictly follow a 12-chapter syllabus. Each chapter will cover a specific topic within Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics as defined in the project's high-level specification.

## 2. Format Rules

*   **Docusaurus Compatibility**: All documentation and textbook chapters must be written in Docusaurus-compatible Markdown (.md or .mdx) to ensure proper rendering and functionality within the Docusaurus framework.
*   **Heading Structure**: Use H2 headings (##) for all main sections within chapters and documentation. Subsections should use H3 (###) and so on, following a logical hierarchy.
*   **Mathematical Equations**: All mathematical equations must be formatted using LaTeX syntax. Inline equations should be enclosed in single dollar signs (`$equation$`), and block equations should be enclosed in double dollar signs (`$$equation$$`).
*   **Code Snippets**: Code examples must be enclosed in fenced code blocks with appropriate language highlighting (e.g., ```python, ```javascript, ```cpp).

## 3. AI Agent Rules

*   **Constitution Reference**: Any future AI Agents or Subagents involved in generating, modifying, or reviewing content or code for this project **must always reference this Constitution** before performing their tasks. This ensures compliance with all established rules and maintains consistency and quality across the project.
*   **Rule Prioritization**: In case of any conflict or ambiguity, the rules outlined in this Constitution take precedence over any other guidelines or specifications, unless explicitly overridden by a project maintainer.
